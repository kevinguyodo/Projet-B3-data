# 🟢 Launch

Once the project has been downloaded, let's launch ``Pycharm''.

To launch the project, we'll need to run the file called ``main.py``, which will enable us to create a database from the data in the various csv files.

To run the storytelling file, launch Jupyter Notebook, then run the file ````storytelling_drug.ipynb````, then execute each cell.

# 🏛 Structure

- ``/data/*.csv`` : Csv file from dataset.
- ``/script/clean_db.py``: File used to create a database with data from the ``/data/Drug_clean.csv``.
- ``/script/initial_db.py``: File used to create a database with data from the ``/data/Drug.csv``.
- ``/script/final_db.py``: File used to create a database with data from the ``/data/final_drug.csv`` which is created when the notebook is run.
- ``main.py``: Main file that uses every function in the above-mentioned python files. This file is also used to create the interactive plot.
- ``storytelling_drug.ipynb``: Storytelling file.
